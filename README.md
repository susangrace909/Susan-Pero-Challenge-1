# Code Refactor Starter Code

- As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When I view the sourcecode, I find semantic HTML elements.

- When I view the structure of HTML elements, I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.

- When I view the image elements, I find accessible alt attributes.

- When I view the heading attributes, they fall in sequential order.

- When I view the title element, I find a concise, descriptive title.

## Assets

The following images are used in the site:

- [brand awareness](brand-awareness.png)
- [cost management](cost-management.png)
- [digital marketing](digital-marketing-meeting.jpg)
- [lead generation](lead-generation.png)
- [online reputation](online-reputation-management.jpg)
- [search engine optimization](search-engine-optimization.jpg)
- [social media marketing](social-media-marketing.jpg)

## Things I changed in the CSS:

- I combined the styles for all of the main blue placards: same style for Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, Social Media Marketing, and images.

- I combined the styles for all of the sidebar content: same style for Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, Cost Management, and images.

## Things I changed in the Index:

- Added HTML semantics: aside, nav, section.

- Ensured logical structure while adding to code.

- Added alternate text to images.

- Put heading attributes in sequential order, not numbered.

- Changed title to Horiseon Social Services.
